# HMLP

HMLP is the biggest project I made for now that its name stands for Help My Language Pronounciation. This is supposed to be a program for me but idc if other people use it. It is needed to install the playsound library for the next updates. Feel free to tell me a suggestion for the program.

For now the lanugages which you can check its alphabets are:
* Spanish
* Russian
* Greek
* Japanese (not Kanji, only its phonetic alphabets aka Hiragana and Katakana)
* Hebrew (no "Geresh" and "Volwel points")
